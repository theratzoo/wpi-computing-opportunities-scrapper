### WPI CS Opportunities Web Scrapper

This is used to get email notifications about a new opportunity!

How to use:

1) Set up a dummy gmail acount. Make sure to allow it to use 3rd party apps (under settings).
2) Set up a .env file, with the following information:
    a) SENDER_ADDRESS=''
    b) RECEIVER_ADDRESS=''
    c) SENDER_PASSSWORD=''
3) Install any libraries you are missing with pip/pip3.
4) Run the code. It is recommended to run it in the background (using the & sign after the command).

In the lastentry.txt file, I have an older entry for testing purposes. This is useful so, after running the script for the first time, you can confirm that it works.
